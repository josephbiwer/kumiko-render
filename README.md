# kumiko-render
Framework to render different kumiko designs

### To Do
- Rework grid... Allow for different number of sides for base shape (triangle, square, pentagon, etc.), modifying shapes so that they can be replicated
    [X] Equilateral Triangles
    [] Squares
    [] Rectangles?
- Add controls to dynamically scale the panel in the DOM
    [] Delta
    [] Density of points
[] Click and drag for adding pieces
[] Export data/image
[] Refactor code
    [] Create graph class, representing different kumiko grid shapes
    [] Create fractal class (layer on top of graph class) to control traversing through graph
